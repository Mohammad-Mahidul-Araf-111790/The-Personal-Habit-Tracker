Based on the current application structure, here is a list of potential pages and features to develop:

- **Settings Page:** A dedicated page for application-wide settings, such as notification preferences, theme customization, and account settings.

- **Progress/Analytics Page:** A page to visualize users' progress over time. This could include charts and graphs for habit completion, streaks, and other relevant metrics.

- **Social/Community Page:** A feature to allow users to connect with friends, share their progress, and participate in challenges. This could include user profiles and a feed.

- **Help/Support Page:** A page with FAQs, tutorials, and contact information for support.

- **Goals Page:** A section for users to set, track, and manage long-term goals that their habits contribute to.

- **Detailed Habit View:** A page to view the history and detailed statistics for a single habit.

- **Export/Import Data:** While there is an API route for data export, a user-facing page to manage data exports and imports would be useful.
